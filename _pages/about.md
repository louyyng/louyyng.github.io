I am a **pentester** currently studying **offensive security development**.

## My Journey

My path in cybersecurity has been focused on hands-on learning and practical application. Starting as a pentester, I've been expanding my skills into offensive security development to build custom tools and solutions.

## Current Work & Projects

I'm actively practicing and developing my skills through various projects:

- **Custom C2 (Command & Control) Framework**: Developing a custom C2 framework to understand the inner workings of command and control systems from both offensive and defensive perspectives.

- **Pentest Automation Tool**: Developing automation tools for penetration testing to improve efficiency and consistency in security assessments.

- **Automated Reporting Tool**: Building tools to streamline the penetration testing workflow, focusing on automating report generation and data collection.

These projects are still in development and may not be perfect.

## Learning & Growth

Each project teaches me something new about security, development, and the intersection of both. My goal is to continue growing as an offensive security developer while contributing to the security community through my work and research.
