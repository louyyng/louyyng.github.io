By day, I'm a penetration tester, fluent in testing web, API, mobile, and network vulnerabilities. By night, I try to dive deeper.  
<br />
For a long time, I performed in pentest. However, I try to get into building the tools such as creating custom C2 designed to navigate the defenses of EDR/XDR solutions like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.  
<br />
Sometime, I do bug hunting for fun, or building automation scripts to make the hunt more efficient.
